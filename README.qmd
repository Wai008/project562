# Executive Summary 

## An analysis of contraceptive knowledge, practice and unmet need among current married women aged 15-49 based on demographic characteristics in Myanmar

Myanmar, also known as Burma, is located in Southeast Asia, sharing borders with several countries, including Bangladesh to the west, India to the northwest, China to the northeast, Laos to the east, and Thailand to the southeast. Administratively, it consists of 7 states, 7 regions, and 1 union territory. The total population is approximately 52 million, comprising a diverse range of 135 ethnic groups. The different terms “state” and “region” are intentionally used in Myanmar to differentiate the geographical locations between one dominant ethnic population, which is Bamar, accounting for 68% of the total population, with the majority residing in the regions and other ethnic minority populations typically inhabiting the states. 

Since 1962, certain regions such as Chin, Kachin, Kayin, and Rakhine states have experienced significant armed conflicts between pro-Bamar government military forces and ethnic armed groups. Consequently, these conflict-affected areas lag behind in terms of development, facing disparities, for instance, access to healthcare, and education compared to their non-conflicted counterparts.

Specifically focusing on healthcare, significant disparities exist in health service accessibility across different ethnic populations, influenced by various demographic characteristics, including conflict-affected situations. However, there is limited data-driven evidence to quantify the extent of these disparities at the state/region level. To address this gap, we conducted an analysis using a nationally representative dataset to examine the associations between demographic characteristics and family planning service accessibility inequities in Myanmar.

For the analysis, we used the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) dataset, conducted by the Ministry of Health and Sports (MoHS) in Myanmar with funding support from USAID in 2016. This survey employed stratified two-stage cluster sampling and weighted sample size calculation methods to ensure national representativeness and validity. The dataset encompasses a wide range of demographic and health-related information, including family planning practices among women aged 15-49, producing a series of datasets for different levels of households and individuals. Among all the available datasets, we selected the family planning dataset, which is an individual-level dataset that focuses specifically on family planning knowledge and practices of women aged 15-49, with a total of 12,885 participants. Our assumption in choosing this dataset is that family planning services using contraceptive methods that allow people to determine how many children and when they want to attain children is one of the widely used indicators to measure health inequities among different populations. *to write more about current married women*

Given our research focus on health equities among ethnic populations, we formulated our research question: How do demographic characteristics influence contraceptive knowledge, practices and unmet need among different ethnic groups? We categorized exposure variables such as age, regional location, type of residence,  education status, and wealth index while outcome variables included knowledge, practice and unmet need of contraception among current married women aged 15-49.
To facilitate this analysis, we stratified exposure variables based on demographic features and research interests. Specifically, we divided regional locations into conflict-affected states and non-conflicted states, the type of residence into urban and rural areas, and education status into four levels - no education, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. *to write age and wealth index* Outcome variables, knowledge, practice and unmet need of contraception were assessed among women in selected regions and states, with varying participant sizes based on eligibility criteria.
