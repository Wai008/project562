## Demographics

::: aside

- 52 million population with ~ 135 ethnic groups. Has 7 states and 7 regions. 
- "Bamar" in regions and ">100 ethnic groups" in states

## Research Question 

::: {.incremental}
- How do demographic characteristics influence contraceptive knowledge, practices and unmet need among currently married women aged 15-49 in Myanmar?

- Are there any contraceptive disparities between States and Regions?

- Bonus info: What are the _most used contraceptive methods_?
:::


## Dataset


DHS Myanmar dataset 2016 

- 7870 observations and 26 variables
- All participants are currently married women aged 15-49


Key variables: 

- Demographic characteristics: age (5-yr group), location (region/state), residence (urban/rural), education, wealth index

- Outcome: contraceptive knowledge, practice, unmet need

## Conclusions

- Our findings underscore disparities in knowledge, practice, and unmet needs underscored across demographics. 
- Sampling weights in our analysis enhance representativeness
- However, there are some limitations such as unaccounted confounders and data constraints.
- Despite limitations, results remain valuable for informing policy and guiding interventions.
- Critical for ongoing evaluation of reproductive health projects.
